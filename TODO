Extract ghc options via TH to include in hint configuration.
  -- nearly done.  Is waiting on a hint patch, or some other workaround.
  -- needs a double-check that it's picking up all the options it should be.

document EVERYTHING.
  -- low-level per-function documentation
  -- mid-level per-module documentation
  -- high-level design documentation

Fix broken SIGINT handler installed by the ghc api via hint.
  -- There might be an updated release of hint to fix this
  -- failing that, either rewrite signal handlers myself, in
  -- two languages, or abuse the signal handler it does install

Figure out why building the TH splices in StarterTH is SO slow.

Make the initial web page a bit better.
