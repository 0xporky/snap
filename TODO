document EVERYTHING.
  -- low-level per-function documentation
  -- mid-level per-module documentation
  -- high-level design documentation

  -- There might be an updated release of hint to fix this
  -- failing that, either rewrite signal handlers myself, in
  -- two languages, or abuse the signal handler it does install

Figure out why building the TH splices in StarterTH is SO slow.
